## Hi there üëã

My name is Harel Mazor,
If you are reading this it might mean you would like to know more about me, my past experience and what I'm currently working on.
That's great!

I ‚ù§Ô∏è open source, and I try to contribute back to every open source library I use.
Either by opening a PRs to fix things, improve stuff, add a feature or at least report issues I find when I'm using these great pieces of software.

I try to keep [my Linked In profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harel-mazor-1298b139/) up-to-date, so I enocouraghe you to take a look there.
It has my current job, the projects I do, videos of lectures I did and other cool stuff.
DM me there if you'd like to talk more!

I also write from time to time on Medium, so you can check [my articles there](https://medium.com/@harel.mazor).
